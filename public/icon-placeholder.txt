PWA Icon Placeholders Needed:

Create these files in the public/ folder:
- pwa-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- pwa-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 pixels)

You can generate these at: https://realfavicongenerator.net/

Or use any simple Sudoku grid icon/logo.

For now, the app will work without these, but you'll see console warnings.
